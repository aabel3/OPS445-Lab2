# OPS445 Lab 2 – User Input, Conditionals, and Loops

Welcome to OPS445 Lab 2!

In this lab, you will expand your Python programming skills by learning how to interact with users, control program flow, and repeat tasks using loops. You’ll practice techniques such as:
Prompting for input from the user
Handling command-line arguments
Using conditional execution (if, if/elif/else)
Writing and debugging while loops

📚 Lab Objectives:
Learn two methods of obtaining user input:
Prompting with the input() function
Using command-line arguments via sys.argv
Apply conditional statements to control program behavior
Practice looping constructs with while statements
Combine loops and conditionals for more complex logic
Strengthen debugging skills by interpreting error messages and fixing logic errors

📂 Lab Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this lab:
lab2a.py – Prompting for input
lab2b.py – Input for name and age
lab2c.py – Using command-line arguments
lab2d.py – Conditional execution with if
lab2e.py – Conditional execution with if/elif/else
lab2f.py – While loops with arguments
lab2g.py – Combining loops and conditionals
laboutput.txt – Output log from the checking script

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
Use input() to capture user data and store it in variables.
Compare prompted input vs. command-line arguments to understand different ways of passing data.
Experiment with conditional branches by testing multiple inputs (e.g., correct vs. incorrect passwords).
Practice writing loops that terminate based on conditions (e.g., limited login attempts).
Keep your code modular and well-commented for easier debugging and review.
